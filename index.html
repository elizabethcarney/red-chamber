              <p>A map of Prospect Garden painted by 孙温 (Sun Wen) in the late 19th century. The white wall around the Garden is clearly visible, penning in its fantastical mansions and landscaping.</p>
            </div>
            <br><h3>A Boundary between Worlds</h3><br>
            <p>The Garden’s main gate represents the boundary between real life and illusory paradise. 
              It is a handsome gatehouse, sparingly decorated with wood and marble carvings, and on its either side you see the bare whitewashed wall surrounding the Garden. 
              The side of the gate facing the outside world features “exquisite workmanship” but is “unadorned by colour or gilding.” 
              It only has the marble carvings on the floor and a “simple pattern” at its bottom for decoration (VI, 327). 
              To a visitor, the gate would look stately and well-built, but plain. Its simple features model Confucian values such as order and elegant functionality.</p>
            <div class="captioned" style="float:right; width:40%; padding-left:20px;">

              <p>A painting of Jia Yuanchun, the Imperial Concubine and Baoyu’s treasured older sister. Painted by An Ho, 1993, watercolor on silk mounted on rice paper using traditional Chinese technique. She is formally depicted in an imperial gown and crown, highlighting her stature.</p>
            </div>
            <br><p>Yet, as soon as you cross the threshold, you are drawn into a world of fantasy and beauty; through the doors you see a dramatic mountain covered in lush foliage (VI, 327). 
              The rest of the vast park is even more impressive. Shimmering lakes, fields of flowers, artful pavilions, and grand mansions are everywhere you look. 
              The Garden is truly a paradise full of luxury, and it functions as a stark contrast to the outside world. 
              There is an abundance of passion, youth, beauty, and opulence within the Garden walls. 
              The main gate is a clear symbol of the Garden’s other-worldliness, and it asserts that the dreams found inside could never survive in the real world.</p>
            <br><h3>The Origin of the Garden</h3><br>
            <p>The Garden is created so that the Imperial Concubine Jia Yuanchun, Baoyu’s much-loved older cousin, can visit home. 
              The Palace requires that she must stay in a secure place, and since she is royalty, it must be luxurious as well. 
              The Jia family spares no expense to construct the most extravagant haven they can for her. When Yuanchun enters the Garden, 
              she aptly describes it as “a little world wholly dedicated to the pursuit of ease and luxury and delight” (VI, 357). 
              After her visit, she suggests that the girls of the household move into the various dwellings in the Garden to enjoy it to the fullest, and Baoyu is allowed to join them.</p>
            <br><p>The girls’ arrival breathes life into the Garden again. Baoyu is “blissfully happy”; he spends all of his time surrounded by his cousins and maids, 
              playing instruments, writing poetry, singing, reading, writing calligraphy, and soaking in the natural beauty surrounding him (VI, 460). Living in the Garden is his paradise. 
              He later refers to his early days in the Garden as the “golden ages,” and remembers being surrounded by the girls with great nostalgia.</p>

      <h3>About</h3><br>
      <p>红楼梦 (Hongloumeng), translated as Dream of the Red Chamber, is undoubtedly one of the greatest classical Chinese novels in existence. It was written by 曹雪芹 (Cao Xueqin) in the late eighteenth century. 
        The story revolves around the affluent Jia family and its slow decline into tragedy, combining detailed descriptions of society with folklore and divine encounters. 
        Along the way, 曹 emphasizes themes of truth and illusion, love and lust, passion and duty, and more. One particularly significant setting in the novel is 大观园 (Daguanyuan), 
        translated as “Prospect Garden” by David Hawkes and “Grand View Garden” by others. You are welcome to explore the map of the Garden above however you like.</p>
      <br><p>It is important to note that all of my analysis is being done through translation; translated names and page numbers come from David Hawkes’ translation published by Penguin Classics. 
        (Authorship of the fifth volume is credited to Gao E and was translated by John Minford).</p>
      <br><p>This map was created as the final project for a seminar on Dream of the Red Chamber that I took during the spring of 2020. Many thanks to Professor Sujane Wu!</p>
    </div>
    <div id="goals" class="text_section">
      <h3>Project Goals</h3><br>
      <p>I had three major goals for this project: first, to create an accessible, interactive English-language tool supplementing the text of Dream of the Red Chamber; 
        second, to provide a visual rendering of a significant setting in the novel; and third, to analyze connections between the Garden’s landscape and the major themes found throughout the novel. 
        Since 红楼梦 has 120 chapters, it is seldom read front-to-back, and reading it at all is difficult since it is such a mammoth wall of text. 
        Hopefully, supplementing the reading with paintings, music, shows, and more will make it easier to dive into the text itself. 
        I also hope that creating an online tool could help introduce unfamiliar readers to the world of 红楼梦 and become more interested in Chinese literature; 
        there are still very few English resources dedicated to the novel online, but I believe the community will continue to grow.</p>
      <br><p>I made decisions about the design of the website with those goals in mind, and added certain features to enhance the feeling of fantasy surrounding the Garden. 
        For example, the big-picture map clearly illustrates the wall around the Garden, separating it from the reality of the outside world. It does not show clear paths between any of the buildings, 
        representing how disorienting the Garden is and making it seem less realistic. The unnaturally vibrant colors on the map lessen its realism as well.</p>
    </div>

      <h3>Preexisting Projects</h3><br>
      <p>Although I set out to create something slightly different from what I could already find online, I did reference several exciting preexisting projects about 红楼梦 for research. They are listed below:</p>
