            </div>
            <br><h3>A Boundary between Worlds</h3><br>
            <p>The Garden’s main gate represents the boundary between real life and illusory paradise. 
              It is a handsome gatehouse, sparingly decorated with wood and marble carvings, and on its either side you see the bare whitewashed wall surrounding the Garden. 
              The side of the gate facing the outside world features “exquisite workmanship” but is “unadorned by colour or gilding.” 
              It only has the marble carvings on the floor and a “simple pattern” at its bottom for decoration (V1, 327). 
              To a visitor, the gate would look stately and well-built, but plain. Its simple features model Confucian values such as order and elegant functionality.</p>

              <p>A painting of Jia Yuanchun, the Imperial Concubine and Baoyu’s treasured older sister. Painted by An Ho, 1993, watercolor on silk 
                mounted on rice paper using traditional Chinese technique. She is formally depicted in an imperial gown and crown, highlighting her stature
                (<a href="https://museum.oglethorpe.edu/exhibits/ho-jia-yuanchun/">source</a>).</p>
            </div>
            <br><p>Yet, as soon as you cross the threshold, you are drawn into a world of fantasy and beauty; through the doors you see a dramatic mountain covered in lush foliage (V1, 327). 
              The rest of the vast park is even more impressive. Shimmering lakes, fields of flowers, artful pavilions, and grand mansions are everywhere you look. 
              The Garden is truly a paradise full of luxury, and it functions as a stark contrast to the outside world. 
              There is an abundance of passion, youth, beauty, and opulence within the Garden walls. 
              The main gate is a clear symbol of the Garden’s other-worldliness, and it asserts that the dreams found inside could never survive in the real world.</p>
            <br><h3>The Origin of the Garden</h3><br>
            <p>The Garden is created so that the Imperial Concubine Jia Yuanchun, Baoyu’s much-loved older cousin, can visit home. 
              The Palace requires that she must stay in a secure place, and since she is royalty, it must be luxurious as well. 
              The Jia family spares no expense to construct the most extravagant haven they can for her. When Yuanchun enters the Garden, 
              she aptly describes it as “a little world wholly dedicated to the pursuit of ease and luxury and delight” (V1, 357). 
              After her visit, she suggests that the girls of the household move into the various dwellings in the Garden to enjoy it to the fullest, and Baoyu is allowed to join them.</p>
            <br><p>The girls’ arrival breathes life into the Garden again. Baoyu is “blissfully happy”; he spends all of his time surrounded by his cousins and maids, 
              playing instruments, writing poetry, singing, reading, writing calligraphy, and soaking in the natural beauty surrounding him (V1, 460). Living in the Garden is his paradise. 
              He later refers to his early days in the Garden as the “golden ages,” and remembers being surrounded by the girls with great nostalgia.</p>

              <p>A photo of a stone lion statue on a bridge at West Lake in Hangzhou.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Drenched Blossoms Pavilion sits atop a striking white marble bridge. A pair of lion statues decorate the roof, their jaws wide, displaying the family’s wealth. 
              They also symbolize the balance of yin and yang there, as there is one of each sex. 
              Flowers in beautiful colors fall from banks higher up the stream and are carried with the flow of the water into the pool that the bridge stretches over. 
              Sitting over the lake is especially idyllic, because you can see the fresh green color of the willows along the banks, vivid flowers poking out of bushes and trees, 
              and clear blue water below, all in one view. Drenched Blossoms is one example of the many pavilions in the Garden dedicated solely to relaxation and the enjoyment of nature.</p>
            <br><p>These sorts of pavilions and verandas are often chosen as locales for Poetry Club meetings. 
              Later in the novel, Baoyu frequently associates the Poetry Club with long gone “golden days” and thinks of it with great nostalgia. 
              I believe that the Poetry Club becomes a symbol of lost happiness for him not only because all of the women he loves gather around him, 
              but also because the meetings take place in the most beautiful natural spaces in the Garden. 
              The pure beauty of the landscape contributes to the feeling that each moment is paradise for Baoyu.</p>

              <p>孙温 (Sun Wen) painted this illustration in the late 19th century. Although we cannot be sure exactly which part of the Garden it depicts, 
                the breathtaking marble bridge with a pavilion at the top and waterfall below suggest that it is Drenched Blossoms Weir

            </div>
            <br><h3>The Garden Meets the Real World</h3><br>
            <p>Since 红楼梦 <i>(Dream of the Red Chamber)</i> has been studied in extraordinary depth for centuries, 
              it is understandable that many readers would be inspired to create real-world replicas of the settings in the novel. 
              Major recreations of Prospect Garden have been created in both Beijing and Shanghai, both open to visitors. The replica gardens are surely a fantastic accompaniment to the novel. 
              Being able to physically walk into a world you’ve only read about can be incredibly fun and stimulating, as if your dreams are coming true.</p>
            <div class="captioned" style="float:left; width:40%; padding-right:20px;">
              <img src="img/drenched_3.jpeg" class="portrait"/>
              <p>A photo of a replica Drenched Blossoms Pavilion located in a recreation of Prospect Garden in Shanghai (<a href="https://baike.baidu.com/pic/%E4%B8%8A%E6%B5%B7%E5%A4%A7%E8%A7%82%E5%9B%AD/1508667/0/a6efce1b9d16fdfa1bf02923b58f8c5495ee7b5b?fr=lemma&ct=single#aid=0&pic=71cf3bc79f3df8dccd25258cca11728b47102896">source</a>).</p>
            </div>
            <br><p>However, creating a replica of the buildings and landscapes in the Garden in the real world ignores the fact that the Garden is not grounded in reality. 
              Many scholars consider the Garden to exist in both reality and imagination (Yu). In some ways, it is referred to as an actual dwelling where people study, eat, and sleep; 
              on the other hand, the symbology of the Garden almost overwhelms its reality. Several magical events take place there, including demonic possessions, curses, and miracle healings. 
              Furthermore, both Baoyu and Daiyu are physical incarnations of divine beings, so their presence strengthens any existing supernatural forces in the Garden. 
              Perhaps plaques, artworks, or even artificial reality activities could be added to the replicas to tell the dreamworld side of the Garden’s story.</p>

              <p>A painting of Lin Daiyu, as imagined by An Ho. Painted in 1993, with watercolor on silk mounted on rice paper using traditional Chinese technique. 
                In this depiction, she wears a Jade “crane-cloud” pin in her hair that symbolizes her integrity (<a href="https://museum.oglethorpe.edu/exhibits/ho-lin-daiyu/">source</a>).</p>
            </div>
            <br><h3>The Passionate Resident</h3><br>
            <p>The Naiad’s House is a whitewashed building enveloped in a thick forest of bamboo. Lin Daiyu lives here; she is a highly-educated, 
              intensely passionate individual who grew up inseparable with Baoyu, yet she is technically an outsider in the family. 
              The greens and blues of her house’s landscape can create a melancholy atmosphere. Bamboo is known as one of the “Four Gentlemen” plants in China 
              (the others being chrysanthemum, plum blossom, and orchid). Bai Juyi, an ancient thinker, said that a true gentleman must have a strong mind but not necessarily a strong body 
              (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo#Symbolism_and_culture">source</a>). 
              In this sense, the bamboo plant and Daiyu are both gentlemen; bamboo is known for symbolizing integrity but being physically weak, and Daiyu is intelligent and outspoken but often falls ill.</p>
            <br><h3>The Burial of Flowers</h3><br>
            <p>One day, Baoyu notices that beautiful flower blossoms have fallen to the ground and starts gathering them so that no one will step on them. 
              He runs into Daiyu, who is doing the exact same thing, and has brought a delicate silk bag to bury the blossoms in (V1, 463). They both want to preserve the fallen flowers’ purity and beauty for eternity. 
              Their encounter is an important moment of mutual understanding for the two, but it also reveals the truth of a dark future.</p>
            <div class="captioned" style="float:right; width:40%; padding-left:20px;">
              <img src="img/naiad_3.png" class="portrait"/>
              <p>Digital art illustrating Daiyu’s burial of the flowers, created for the visual novel “The Memory of Red Mansions” by Lea Liu et al (<a href="https://www.lealiu.com/honglou?lightbox=dataItem-j5lbfuw13">source</a>).</p>
            </div>
            <br><p>Girls are often compared to flowers in 红楼梦 <i>(Dream of the Red Chamber)</i>; they have beauty, fragility, grace, youth, and joy in common. 
              In fact, Daiyu is really the physical incarnation of a flower fairy called Crimson Pearl. She realizes that like all blossoms soon wither and die, 
              all the girls’ vitality will soon be stolen away by death, corruption, or numbness. Daiyu obsesses over her certain untimely end and the loss of beauty and purity in the world. 
              Later on, she thinks of the verse: “As flowers fall and the flowing stream runs red, / A thousand sickly fancies crowd the mind” (V1, 467). The beautiful and the natural are destined to die in tragedy.</p>

              <p>A rendition of Song of the Burial of the Flowers by singer Chen Li in 2015. This song was featured on the soundtrack of the TV series version of Dream of the Red Chamber. Daiyu’s thoughts on beauty and death form the lyrics.</p>
            </div>
            <br><h3>Daiyu’s Tragic End</h3><br>
            <p>Daiyu dies alone at a very young age. None of the members of the Jia family come to visit her in the days leading up to her death. 
              She and Baoyu never get to profess their love for each other or marry; in fact, Daiyu spends her final days thinking Baoyu has rejected and abandoned her. 
              The preparations for her death are hasty, and her passing goes unrecognized by many (V4, 350). The purest of flowers dies a very tragic death.</p>

              <p>A painting of Li Wan, who lives in Sweet-rice Village. Painted by An Ho, 1993, watercolor on silk mounted on rice paper using traditional Chinese technique. 
                The artist illustrates Li Wan’s “restrained self-discipline” and “high integrity and propriety” (<a href="https://museum.oglethorpe.edu/exhibits/ho-li-wan/">source</a>).</p>
            </div>
            <br><h3>Beauty in Simplicity</h3><br>
            <p>Sweet-rice Village is a cluster of quaint thatched-roof cottages perched on the side of a small mountain. 
              Fields of fruits and vegetables cascade down the hills below, as if lifted straight out of the countryside, and apricot trees surround each house. 
              The resident of Sweet-rice Village is Li Wan, who “exemplifies traditional Chinese womanhood” according to the Oglethorpe University Museum of Art 
              (<a href="https://museum.oglethorpe.edu/exhibits/ho-li-wan/">source</a>). 
              Her understated demeanor suits the simple style of the cottages here. The overall effect of the Village honors the plain, honest nature of rural life.</p>
            <br><h3>An Unnatural Juxtaposition</h3><br>
            <p>When Baoyu and his father, Jia Zheng, visit Sweet-rice Village on a tour of the Garden, Baoyu quips: “A farm set down in the middle of a place like this is obviously the product of human artifice… 
              That’s why, when the ancients use the term ‘natural’ I have my doubts about what they really meant” (V1, 336). He touches on the realization that the Garden’s idle luxury is neither real nor sustainable. 
              In fact, the entire space is a false paradise, one where beauty thrives for a short time before falling into inescapable anguish.</p>
            <div class="captioned" style="float:left; width:40%; padding-right:20px;">
              <img src="img/sweetrice_2.jpeg" class="portrait"/>
              <p>Artist 戴敦邦 (Dai Dunbang) illustrates Baoyu being brutally beaten by his father, Jia Zheng, who hopes to discipline Baoyu and force him to live in reality for once (<a href="https://www.twoeggz.com/picture/4306738.html">source</a>).</p>
            </div>
            <br><p>Unfortunately, Jia Zheng does not appreciate his son’s examination of the concept of natural-ness. 
              The two are basically complete opposites in terms of their personalities and priorities: Jia Zheng is pragmatic, grounded, authoritative, and unpassionate, and he emphasizes a career in government above all else. 
              Baoyu, on the other hand, is intensely emotional, delicate, fun-loving, divine, and feminine, and he prefers idle happiness to studying. He and his father clash often about Baoyu’s academic progress and careless disobedience. 
              When Baoyu expresses his disillusionment with Sweet-rice Village, his father immediately rebukes him: “Ignoramus!... What can you know of the beauty that lies in quietness and natural simplicity? 
              This is a consequence of your refusal to study properly” (V1, 336).</p>
            <br><p>Later on, after Baoyu commits a series of offenses (in his father’s eyes), Jia Zheng violently beats him nearly to death (V2, 148). They continue to be at odds with each other for the remainder of the novel. 
              The intersection of their two extreme worlds, pure practicality and pure fantasy, can never coexist. However, it is necessary to have a combination of both for sustainable life; 
              Jia Zheng eventually turns to corruption and loses his government position, and Baoyu’s garden haven falls to ruins. Their failure to find balance causes the collapse of the Jia family.</p>

              <p>Painted by 孙温 (Sun Wen) in the late 19th century, this illustration probably depicts a courtyard much like the one in All-Spice Court. The construction of the wooden window lattices and balustrades is impeccable. 
                Note the tree and rock formations, as well, which lend a beautiful fragility to the landscaping (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sun_Wen_Red_Chamber_7.jpg">source</a>). </p>
            </div>
            <div class="captioned" style="float:right; width:30%; padding-left:20px;">
              <img src="img/allspice_3.jpeg" class="portrait"/>
              <p>According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, “strangely faceted rocks—thought of as miniature mountains—have been treasured by collectors since the Tang dynasty (618–907).” 
                This painting by Lan Ying shows the rock’s holes and weathered surface, which make it seem artfully fragile. (<a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/39713">source</a>).</p>
            </div>
            <br><h3>Balance in Traditional Gardens</h3><br>
            <p>All-Spice Court is bursting with sweet-smelling herbs and flowers. Instead of trees and grasses, the courtyard has a rocky terrain where mosses grow on the stone. 
              Wild figs, billowing wisteria, pollia berries, fragile orchids, herbaceous rue, and spicy ginger are a few of the plants that can be found here (in fact, 衡芜 means “ginger plant”). 
              Elegant balustrades and latticed windows line its sides. The couplet written for the Court is: “Composing amidst cardamoms, you shall make verses like flowers. / Slumbering amidst the roses, you shall dream fragrant dreams.” 
              This courtyard displays several elements of traditional Chinese garden design, most notably balance. For example, the soft herbs and mosses grow on hard, sharp rocks. 
              Sculptural rocks riddled with holes have also been a popular feature for centuries, since they have a beautiful fragility and help create different levels of perspective 
              (<a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cgrk/hd_cgrk.htm">source</a>).</p>
            <br><p>Xue Baochai lives here. She is very kind to others, but in a calculating way; she knows exactly how to play the social scene to get ahead. She is a capable manager, too. 
              Baochai is often described as cold, which makes sense since her surname sounds like the word for snow in Chinese. Her upbringing, refined personality, 
              and pragmatism make her an excellent candidate for Baoyu’s wife in the eyes of the Jia family. Although the sweet smells in the courtyard might suggest the resident is sensual or passionate, Baochai is particularly unemotional.</p>
            <br><h3>Marriage as Corruption</h3><br>
            <p>Baoyu always imagines Lin Daiyu as his future wife and lover, and Daiyu reciprocates those wishes. Their love for each other is unimaginably powerful. 
              However, it is clear that Daiyu is not an ideal wife for Baoyu according to his family, because she does not have the social knowledge nor strength to manage the sprawling household as an outsider. 
              Her sickly constitution, harshness, and frequent mood swings also make her unfavorable marriage-wise. Baochai, on the other hand, is theoretically Baoyu’s realistic perfect match. 
              His family hopes that she can handle his high emotions and tone down his boyishness. A combination of Daiyu and Baochai would form Baoyu’s perfect wife, because she could satisfy his need for passion as well as the outside need for poise.</p>
            <br><p>In any case, marriage is constantly associated with corruption in the novel; as soon as a girl marries, her purity, youth, and beauty fade and she is consumed by the world. </p>

            <p>Baoyu is especially fretful when his cousins get married, because they move out and rarely see him afterwards. He even equates marriage with death several times. As his older cousins are married off and leave him one by one, 
              he starts to realize that his pure world is being corrupted and the world with no passion is taking over. Marrying Daiyu is the only way Baoyu could endure marriage and maintain his purity. 
              Sadly, Baoyu’s family tricks him into marrying Baochai when he thinks he is marrying Daiyu. His loveless marriage starts to corrupt him as well; his happiness dies.</p>

      </div>
      <p>红楼梦 (Hongloumeng), translated as Dream of the Red Chamber, is undoubtedly one of the greatest classical Chinese novels in existence. It was written by 曹雪芹 (Cao Xueqin) in the late eighteenth century. 
        The story revolves around the affluent Jia family and its slow decline into tragedy, combining detailed descriptions of society with folklore and divine encounters. 
        Along the way, 曹 emphasizes themes of truth and illusion, love and lust, passion and duty, and more. One particularly significant setting in the novel is 大观园 (Daguanyuan), 
        translated as “Prospect Garden” by David Hawkes and “Grand View Garden” by others. You are welcome to explore the map of the Garden above however you like.</p>
      <br><p>It is important to note that all of my analysis is being done through translation; translated names and page numbers come from David Hawkes’ translation published by Penguin Classics. 
        (Authorship of the fifth volume is credited to Gao E and was translated by John Minford).</p>
      <br><p>This map was created as the final project for a seminar on Dream of the Red Chamber that I took during the spring of 2020. Many thanks to Professor Sujane Wu!</p>

      <h3>Project Goals</h3><br>
      <p>I had three major goals for this project: first, to create an accessible, interactive English-language tool supplementing the text of Dream of the Red Chamber; 
        second, to provide a visual rendering of a significant setting in the novel; and third, to analyze connections between the Garden’s landscape and the major themes found throughout the novel. 
        Since 红楼梦 has 120 chapters, it is seldom read front-to-back, and reading it at all is difficult since it is such a mammoth wall of text. 
        Hopefully, supplementing the reading with paintings, music, shows, and more will make it easier to dive into the text itself. 
        I also hope that creating an online tool could help introduce unfamiliar readers to the world of 红楼梦 and become more interested in Chinese literature; 
        there are still very few English resources dedicated to the novel online, but I believe the community will continue to grow.</p>
      <br><p>I made decisions about the design of the website with those goals in mind, and added certain features to enhance the feeling of fantasy surrounding the Garden. 
        For example, the big-picture map clearly illustrates the wall around the Garden, separating it from the reality of the outside world. It does not show clear paths between any of the buildings, 
        representing how disorienting the Garden is and making it seem less realistic. The unnaturally vibrant colors on the map lessen its realism as well.</p>
